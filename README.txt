This is my solution to solving Project 1: 8-Puzzle Problem. I decided to use an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach.
All the classes and methods are defined at the top of the python program. The instances of the classes, test cases, and goal
states are defined at the bottom of the code. The 8_puzzle_program.py file relies solely on numpy and deque (from collections).
To run the file, simply press run. You can change the test cases at the bottom of the program by uncommenting various node_states.
Be sure to check that the node_state you are running is a solvable state for the 8-Puzzle-Problem, as about have of the possible
configuration are unsolvable. The animate.py file is a script that visualizes the puzzle and path that is generated by the BFS
algorithm. To run the animate.py file you also need to have pygame installed.
